// input boxes need to be validated.)

// 2- Write a program which takes two numbers from the console and displays the maximum of the two.

// 3- Write a program and ask the user to enter the width and height of an image.Then tell if the image is landscape or portrait.

// 4- Your job is to write a program for a speed camera.For simplicity, ignore the details such as camera, sensors, etc and focus
// purely on the logic.Write a program that asks the user to enter the speed limit. Once set, the program asks for the speed of a
// car.If the user enters a value less than the speed limit, program should display Ok on the console.If the value is above the
// speed limit, the program should calculate the number of demerit points.For every 5km/hr above the speed limit, 1 demerit points
// should be incurred and displayed on the console. If the number of demerit points is above 12, the program should display License
// Suspended.

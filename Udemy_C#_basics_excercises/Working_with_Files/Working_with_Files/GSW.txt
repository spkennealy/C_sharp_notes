The Golden State Warriors had a very Golden State Warriors problem this season: They were too good. Other teams would be delighted to have such issues. But the reigning NBA champions had so much talent and so little incentive for so much of the regular season that it became a chore for them to unleash the full powers of their superteam. They were the only team in the league that could afford to be bored. They knew they were good enough to get away with it. They were right. The Warriors are now the back-to-back NBA champions after crushing LeBron James and the other Cleveland Cavaliers, 108-85, on Friday night to complete their anticlimactic Finals sweep of the greatest player of this basketball generation and establish themselves as the sport’s latest dynasty. Golden State has three titles in four years—in the one season they lost to the Cavaliers, they had to settle for winning the most regular-season games of any team in NBA history—but this is the championship that elevates the Warriors into the stratosphere of teams good enough for long enough to define the eras in which they played. The Warriors have an unprecedented winning percentage over the last four years, and their latest win launches them into the company of the Los Angeles Lakers in the 2000s (three consecutive titles), Michael Jordan’s Chicago Bulls of the 1990s (six titles in eight years), the Showtime Lakers of the 1980s (three titles in four years) and Bill Russell’s Boston Celtics of the 1960s (eight straight titles) as the best NBA teams of all time. This may not be the end of their run, either. They still have their absurd concentration of star power in Stephen Curry, Kevin Durant, Klay Thompson and Draymond Green, and the Warriors will begin next season the way they started and finished the last two seasons: as the heavy favorite to win yet another NBA title.

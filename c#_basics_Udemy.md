# C# Basics for Beginners: Learn C# Fundamentals by Coding

### **Difference between C# and .NET**
* C# is a programming language.
* .NET is a framework for building web applications.
    * .NET is not limited to C#
    * Made of 2 components:
        * CLR - Common language runtime
        * Class library

### **What is CLR?**

CLR is essentially an application whose job it is to translate the IL (Intermediate Language) code into the machine code. This process is called JIT.

### **Architecture of .NET Applications**

Application will consist of `classes`. Classes are a blueprint for data and methods. Classes have attributes and actions.

`Namespace` is a container for related classes. As namespaces grow, we need another container called an `assembly`.

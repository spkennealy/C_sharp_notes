## **Section 8: Composite**

* Treating individual and aggregate objects uniformly.

**Motivation**
* Objects use other objects' fields/properties/members through inheritance and composition
* Composition lets us make compound objects
    * E.g., a mathematical expression composed of simple expressions; or 
    * A grouping of shapes that consists of several shapes
* Compostie design pattern is used to treat both single (scalar) and composite objects uniformly
    * I.e., Foo and Collection<Foo> have common APIs

**Composite**
* A mechanism for treating individual (scalar) objects and compositions of objects in a uniform manner.

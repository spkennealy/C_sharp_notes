## **Section 6: Adapter**

* Electircal devices have different power (interface) requirements.
    * Voltage (5V, 220V)
    * Socket/plug type (Europe, UK, USA)
* We cannot modify our gadgets to support every possible interface
    * Some support possible (e.g., 120/220V)
* Thus, we use a special device (an adapter) to give us the interface we require from the interface we have

**Adapter**
* A construct which adapts an existing interface X to conform to the required interface Y.
